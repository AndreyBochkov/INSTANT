                INSTANT <span class="attention">2.0</span> is here! Now there are only <span class="attention">groups</span> and channels<span class="attention">,</span> you can change the format of the date-time and (finally) enjoy <span class="attention">automatic reconnection</span> in case of network break.
            </p>
            <p>
                The INSTANT application and infrastructure are running in test mode. Significant changes to security protocols and data exchange mechanisms may be made. I will not plan the expected duration of the testing period. Thank you for reading.

                What is it?
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is a messenger focused on safety and speed. <span class="attention">The lack of trackers,</span> data collectors and modern encryption algorithms rovide these qualities. The project was developed and launched by one person within the framework of individual work.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h2>
                What are the objectives of INSTANT?
            </h2>
            <p>
                It is immediately necessary to explain that this is a non-commercial project. INSTANT <span class="attention">does not aim to</span> provide you with personalized advertising, <span class="attention">does not aim to</span> raise money. INSTANT is here for the secure exchange of bytes between two devices connected to the Web.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h2>
                Security without HTTPS? I can see, <span class="attention">"http://i</span>..."
            </h2>
            <p>
                Indeed, INSTANT does not use HTTPS on the site. However, the application uses a special encryption protocol based on the simplified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman">Diffie-Hellman algorithm</a> of TLS 1.3, and so that it works incredibly fast. In simple terms, TLS does a lot more for compatibility with any device, and the INSTANT protocol only works between your phone and that server, so it can set a connection for a smaller number of packets.

                Everyone collects data on everyone, it is obvious.
            </h2>
            <p>
                But not private messengers. Yes, this is only for Android, but for iOS there is already <a href="https://bitchat.free/">a "bitchat"</a> that combines users into a decentralized network (without servers), guaranteeing anonymity. INSTANT ensures performance - thanks to centralization. How many startups, so many approaches. But it is profitable to collect data for advertisers, not programmers.

                Yes, they are, as transparent and simple as possible. <a href="/en/privacy">They are on the same site.</a> Keep in mind that <span class="attention">any use of a mobile application involves reading, understanding all points and agreeing with them.</span>

                The INSTANT application is distributed "as is", freely for use. <a href="/INSTANT.apk">It is on the same site.</a> Open the file on your phone and install the app.

                Technical limitations?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Alas, there is. INSTANT <span class="attention">did not negotiate</span> with smartphone manufacturers about the absolute resolution of background activity. INSTANT <span class="attention">does not use</span> Google Firebase Cloud Messaging technology to avoid sharing any data with third-party servers. Because of this, when the screen is turned off, <span class="attention">messages are not delivered</span>. So far, INSTANT is more about safety than about speed, but work is underway to improve.
